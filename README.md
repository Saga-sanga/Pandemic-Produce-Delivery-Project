# About Our Online Shop

During the ongoing pandemic, getting groceries can be a **real challenge**. The scarcity can go beyond delivery time slots. Items you order can run out of stock before being delivered, and if you venture to the store, you may find slim pickings in some aisles. 

It all started out a few weeks ago, when several people in our neighborhood decided to organize a non-contact delivery service to help others during this challengine time. We noticed that some of our friends or families find it challenging to shop outside. They were worried about their safety, and whether they were able to always get the goods that they wanted. Understanding their concerns, we decided to deliver the produce to people's doors without any charge. Since we only have a few people volunteering from time to time, we only have around 5 people as our regular customers. 

The website is our next phase of expansion. We are planning to contact wholesalers in the greater Seattle aread and directly order products from there. This would save more time for us to order the products, as well as open up more buying options for the customers as well. We are planning on using this website as a platform for customers to order goods directly.

# First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice environment? This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.
