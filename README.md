# About Our Online Shop

During the ongoing pandemic, getting groceries can be a real challenge. The scarcity can go beyond delivery time slots. Items you order can run out of stock before being delivered, and if you venture to the store, you may find slim pickings in some aisles. 

It all started out a few weeks ago, when several people in our neighborhood decided to organize a non-contact delivery service to help others during this challengine time. We contacted a few wholesalers, and delivered the produce to people's doors without any charge. Since we only have a few people, we only have around 10 people who are our regular customers. 



# First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice environment? This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.
