Checkpoint 6/28, what we have in the project

Right now, we have the MVC model set up

Model: product and cart

View: admin, shop, and includes
    - admin: containing all the html pages rendering admin content
    - shop: likewsie, rendering all of the shop-related html content
    - includes: common functionaltiies, like nav bar, header, etc.

Controller: shopController and adminController, connecting between model and View

Routes: connecting the main app and the controller, serves as routing purposes

Public: add stylings to the entire project

App.js: main entry point

Directly loading the product's page
    Flow: app -> routes(shopRoutes) -> shopController(getting product's data) -> 
    call render(specify path to the ejs file, and then setting necessar param)

Clicking button on the html page
    Triggers GET/POST request -> going to the specific routes -> repeating the same process
